Working:
- Touch, screen
- Flashing ZIP files (including A/B zips like ROMs)
- Installing IMG files to respective partitions
- Backup, restore to Internal Storage, Micro SD Card, USB OTG
- Shutdown, Reboot to System, Recovery, Fastboot
- Micro SD card 
- ADB, MTP
- Date, Time, Temperature, battery reading
- Decryption (Keymaster 3.0) 

Broken:
- Nothing except decryption in ROMs using keymaster 4.0 (Stock does not support this anyways and custom ROM developers should not use it since there is no point in doing so as the firmware does not support k4.0 features, which results in it running in "legacy" mode)
